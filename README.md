# terraform-cloud-run

## Overview

A Github action to create runs on Terraform Cloud/Enterprise workspaces and fetch workspace outputs to use in Github workflows.

**Note**: This Github action currently only supports a limited set of options for creating a run on a given workspace.

### When are workspace outputs fetched?

Outputs are fetched from a workspace and made available as outputs for your Github action if:
- The run created is **not** a destroy plan **and** the runner is configured to wait for the run to complete.
- If the run is skipped entirely using `skip-run: true`

Outputs that are not of type `string` will be saved as a JSON string, so you would need to use `fromJSON()` to parse these values in your workflow. [Read more about fromJSON()](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#fromjson)

Workspace outputs that are marked as sensitive will be given a mask and set as a secret in the workflow.

### Inputs

- `tfe_token` (**Required**): The token of the TFC/E instance which holds the workspace that manages your tflocal instance.
- `organization` (**Required**): The TFC/E organization that manages the specified workspace.
- `workspace` (**Required**): The name of the TFC/E workspace that manages the tflocal configuration.
- `tfe_hostname` (**Optional**): The hostname of the TFC/E instance which holds the workspace that manages your tflocal instance. Defaults to `app.terraform.io`.
- `skip-run` (**Optional**): If set to `true`, will omit creating a run on the workspace and simply fetch the workspace outputs. Defaults to `false`.
- `wait-for-run` (**Optional**): If set to `true`, runs executed by this action will poll and await completion. Defaults to `false`.

#### Run Creation Options
- `is-destroy` (**Optional**): If set to `true`, will trigger a destroy run on the TFC workspace. Defaults to `false`.
- `auto-apply` (**Optional**): Whether to automatically apply changes when a Terraform plan is successful. Defaults to `true`.
- `message` (**Optional**): The message to associate with the run. Defaults to `Run queued by terraform-cloud-run Github action`.
- `replace-addrs` (**Optional**): A multi-line list of resource addresses to be replaced.
- `target-addrs` (**Optional**): A multi-line list of resources addresses that Terraform should focus its planning efforts on.

### Outputs
- `run-id`: The ID of the run that was created.

Outputs generated by this workflow will match those found in your workspace.
